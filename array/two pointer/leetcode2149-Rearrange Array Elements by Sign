Docstring for array.two pointer.leetcode2149-Rearrange Array Elements by Sign
Given an array nums of 2n integers, you need to rearrange the elements of nums such that the modified array follows the given conditions:
1. Every consecutive pair of integers have opposite signs.
2. For all integers with the same sign, the order in which they were present in nums
is preserved.
The rearranged array begins with a positive integer.
Return the modified array after rearranging the elements to satisfy the aforementioned conditions.
Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,1,-2,-5,2,-4]
Output: [3,-2,1,-5,2,-4]
Explanation: The positive integers in nums are [3,1,2]. The negative integers are [-2,-5,-4]. The only possible rearrangement that satisfies all conditions is [3,-2,1,-5,2,-4].
Example 2:
Input: nums = [-1,1]
Output: [1,-1]
Explanation: 1 is the only integer that satisfies all conditions
Constraints:

1. 2 <= nums.length <= 2 * 10^5
2. nums.length is even
3. -100 <= nums[i] <= 100
4. nums consists of equal number of positive and negative integers.
